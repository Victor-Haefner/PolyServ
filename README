How to use this TURN server:

First register as a user

	regUser.php?NAME=bob

This will return your user ID
Get a list of the other users

	listUsers.php

Choose a user, remember his UID
Then get a TCP connection

	getConnection.php?UID=yourUID&UID2=othersUID

This will make the server listen on a port, the addr:port will be returned
Connect to the server over tcp using the addr:port
Wait for the other user to connect to the session, 
you will be notified over the tcp connection by a "conection established with $UID"
